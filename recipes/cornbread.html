    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cornbread recipe is made from scratch with no mix. It's a real treat with chili, ribs, or barbecued chicken. You could even use this sweet, homemade cornbread to make stuffing for your Thanksgiving feast! My mom made this for me as a child, and now it's my family's favorite. Serve with butter, jam, honey, or your favorite spread.</p>
